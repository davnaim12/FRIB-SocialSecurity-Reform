# FRIB Proposal – Social Security Reform

This repository contains a full legislative proposal to stabilize and protect Social Security without cutting benefits or raising taxes.

It introduces the **Federal Retirement Investment Board (FRIB)**—an independent, nonpartisan board modeled after the Federal Reserve—to invest a portion of the trust fund in safe, diversified assets. It includes a two-stage plan:
- **Stage 1**: Extends solvency by 7–10 years through better trust fund management
- **Stage 2**: Permanently closes the funding gap through long-term investment and modest adjustments
